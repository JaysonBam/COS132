# Imperative Programming 132 Course - Practical Assessments

Welcome to the **Imperative Programming Course Practical Assessments** repository! Here, you'll find my implementations of practical assessments and projects for the Imperative Programming module. This course is a fundamental building block of computer science, teaching you how to create, edit, compile, run, and debug programs to solve various problems. You'll also learn about types, control structures, arrays, functions, libraries, and get an introduction to object orientation.

## Course Description

The **Imperative Programming** module introduces you to the essential concepts and techniques of computer programming. The main focus is on mastering programming language elements and constructing programs that are effective, efficient, and easy to understand. By completing this course, you'll gain the skills to write complete elementary programs, analyze code, and design user-friendly interfaces. The course covers the following topics:

1. Understanding the basic elements of a program.
2. Writing programs using different types and data structures.
3. Applying control structures and decision-making techniques.
4. Working with arrays and functions.
5. Utilizing libraries to enhance program functionality.
6. Introduction to object-oriented programming concepts.

## Practical Assessments

In this repository, you'll find the practical assessments that I completed as part of the Imperative Programming course. Each assessment is provided in separate folders and includes clear instructions, code templates, and any additional resources required to complete the tasks.
